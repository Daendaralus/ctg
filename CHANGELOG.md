# Changelog

## 1.0.0 - 14 Mar 2022 - Public Release

### Added

* A configuration window to set completely custom grouping modes ðŸ¤¯
* v9 keybindings are used for rolling Group Initiative
* Localization for everything
* Add a new option for combatant sorting which improves the group skipping experience
* Option to not group hidden combatants or not group player characters
* Debugging mode (enabled via the DevMode module)

### Fixed

* Various refactors, ci additions, and code style improvements

#### Selection tool

* Using selection tool without any active combats no longer causes console error
* Show group selection control initially on load (it was only visible after switching tools before)

#### Mob Attack Tool integration

* No longer attempts to add Combatants whose tokens are in multiple MAT Mobs to multiple groups, causing some weird nested groups
* Only group by mob if MAT is active
* Compatibility with MAT's new implementation of Group Initiative
* Use the same naming as MAT for mobs created with the save buttons
* No re-rendering for mob changes which caused infinite loop on load

#### Group Skipping

* Group Skipping now works properly with more modes (you may need the new sorting to be enabled)
* Don't skip groups if there is only one group

#### Grouping & Toggles

* Make sure groups are added on initial load in case the combat tracker is rendered before ready
* Don't show combatant context menu on toggles
* The group save button no longer triggers it's toggle
* Re-render the Combat Tracker immediately when the available grouping modes change
* Add the toggles in the same order that the groups are in
* Auto opens the correct toggle more often

#### Group Initiative

* Only play the dice rolling sound once when rolling for Group Initialize

#### Combatant Sorting

* Boolean values now work
* Alphabetical sorting is in the right direction
* Initiative values are instead compared when grouping by IDs
* Groups are sorted by their first combatant
* Sort combatants only when the mode is changed instead of every time the groups are calculated

* [Combat Utility Belt (CUB)](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/combat-utility-belt) "Hide Actor Names" compatibility for group names
* Hooks for mode update, group update, group selection, and group initiative rolling
* Group by Actor mode which allows you to group together Combatants which are from the same Actor, but have different names (such as when using [Token Mold](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/token-mold))
* Only show relevant modes depending on which modules are active:
  * Show "Mob" mode (see above) if MAT is enabled
  * Show "Lancer" mode (see above) if Lancer Initiative is enabled
  * Hides the "Initiative" mode if the [Simultaneous Combat System](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/scs) module is enabled
* Handle automatically changing the current mode to a valid one if the currently saved mode does not exist (such as when enabling or disabling a module with the mode relevancy feature described above)
* Allow creating selection groups with as little as just one token/combatant
* "Skip over Groups" functionality which makes Foundry skip over the rest of combatants in the group when advancing the turn tracker
